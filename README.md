# Poco.Sql
##### Auto generate SQL statements from .NET objects

If you're looking for a .NET Core compatible version check out Poco.Sql.NetCore project (https://github.com/developer82/Poco.Sql.NetCore). It's identical to this version, only ported and compatible with .NET Core.

## Quick Start

Include the Poco.Sql extentions method namespace

```
using Poco.Sql.Extensions;
```

Generate SQL statements from ANY object

```
myObject.PocoSql().Select().ToString();
myObject.PocoSql().Insert().ToString();
myObject.PocoSql().Update().ToString();
myObject.PocoSql().Delete().ToString();
```

[Read the Quick Start guide](https://github.com/developer82/Poco.Sql/wiki/Quick-Start)

**It's that simple!**

## Configuration
Confgiration can be executed only once in the application lifecycle. Once configured, it doesn't allow changing the configuration later on.

Example configuration:
```
// PocoSql configuration
Configuration.Initialize(config =>
{
  config.PluralizeTableNames();
  config.SetStoreProcedurePrefix("stp_");
  config.ShowComments();
  config.InjectValuesInQueies();
  config.SelectFullGraph();
  config.AddMap(new EntityMap());
});
```

## Object Mapping

Poco.Sql works out-of-the-box on any .NET class and without the need to configure or map anything. However, there might be cases where we would like to apply mapping on objects - map relationships between objects, map object properties to database fields, ignore properties, set custom table name for object, define stored procedures, and more...

To allow such mapping, Poco.Sql has a mapping object that helps you define mappings between your objects and the database.

To create a mapping object, create a new class that inherits from `Poco.Sql.PocoSqlMapping<T>`

```
public class UserMap : PocoSqlMapping<User>
{
    public UserMap()
    {
        // mapping configuration
    }
}
```

## Values Object Creator

To save the time and lines of code in writing these objects, Poco.Sql has an helper class that knows how to create an object that's combined of your domain objects, and is specific to SQL statement.

```
var sql = "insert into Users(FirstName, LastName, DateOfBirth, LuckyNumber, IsRegistered) values(@FirstName, @LastName, @DateOfBirth, @LuckyNumber, @IsRegistered)";
var data = ValuesObject.Create(sql, myUserObject /* , ... */);
```
